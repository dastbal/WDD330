<h2>  Chapter 12 :  Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
<p>Canvas was first developed by Apple</p>
<p>The text in between the canvas tags will only be shown if the canvas element is not supported by the visitor’s browser.</p>
<p><b>ACCESSIBILITY CONCERNS</b>
    A major downside of canvas in its current form is its lack of accessibility. The canvas doesn’t create a DOM node, is not a text-based format, and is thus essentially invisible to tools such as screen readers.</p>
<h3>Drap and Drop</h3>
<p> This API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page. This API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.</p>
<p>There are several steps to adding drag and drop to your page: <br>

    Set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you’d like to be draggable.
     <br>
    Add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable HTML elements.
     <br>
    Add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any elements that you want to have accept dropped items.</p>
<p>We’ll need to prevent the default behavior for both these events, since the default prohibits you from dropping an element.</p>
