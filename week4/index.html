                <li>HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS
                    If a number starts with a 0x, it is considered to be in hexadecimal (base 16) notation:
                    
                    0xAF; // A represents 10, F represents 15
                    << 175
                             </li>
                <li>EXPONENTIAL NOTATION
                                Numbers can also be represented in exponential notation, which is shorthand for "multiply by 10 to the power of" (you may have heard this referred to as "scientific notation" or "standard form"). Here are some examples:
                                
                                1e6; // means 1 multiplied by 10 to the power 6 (a million)
                                << 1000000
                                
                                2E3; // 2 multiplied by 10^3 (two thousand)
                                << 2000
                </li>
                <li>
                    Number Methods
Numbers also have some built-in methods, although you need to be careful when using the dot notation with number literals that are integers because JavaScript will confuse the dot with a decimal point. 
                
Use two dots:
<br>

5..toExponential();
>> "5e+0"

<br>

Put a space before the dot:
<br>

5 .toExponential(); >> "5e+0"
<br>
Assign the number to a constant:

const number = 5;
>> 5

number.toExponential();
<br>
>> "5e+0"
                </li>
            </ul>
